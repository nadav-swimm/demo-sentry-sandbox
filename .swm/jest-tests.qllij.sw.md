Our Jest suite covers providing functional and unit testing for frontend components. We favour writing functional tests that interact with components and observe outcomes (navigation, API calls) over checking prop passing and state mutations.

```
# Run jest in interactive mode
yarn test

# Run a single test
yarn test tests/js/spec/views/issueList/overview.spec.js
```

### API Fixtures

Because our Jest tests run without an API we have a variety of fixture builders available to help generate API response payloads. The `TestStubs` global includes all the fixture functions in `ðŸ“„ tests/js/sentry-test`

<br/>

You should also use `MockApiClient.addMockResponse`[<sup id="LnFpM">â†“</sup>](#f-LnFpM) to set responses for API calls your components will make. Failing to mock an endpoint will result in tests failing.

For example:
<!-- NOTE-swimm-snippet: the lines below link your snippet to Swimm -->
### ðŸ“„ tests/js/spec/actionCreators/committers.spec.jsx
```javascript
â¬œ 24       beforeEach(() => {
â¬œ 25         MockApiClient.clearMockResponses();
ðŸŸ© 26         mockResponse = MockApiClient.addMockResponse({
ðŸŸ© 27           url: endpoint,
ðŸŸ© 28           body: mockData,
ðŸŸ© 29         });
â¬œ 30     
â¬œ 31         CommitterStore.init();
â¬œ 32     
```

### Kafka Tests in CI

The Snuba test suite is the only test suite that will actually have Kafka running in CI. If you have a test that needs Kafka running then those tests need to be nested under the Snuba test folder ( `ðŸ“„ tests/snuba` ) If you don't, your tests will timeout and be cancelled in GH actions.
