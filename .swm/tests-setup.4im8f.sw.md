The acceptance and python tests require a functioning set of devservices. It is recommended you use `devservices` to ensure you have the required services running. If you also use your local environment for local testing you will want to use the `--project` flag to separate local testing volumes from test suite volumes:

```
# Turn off services for local testing.
sentry devservices down

# Turn on services with a test prefix to use separate containers and volumes
sentry devservices up --project test

# Verify that test containers came up correctly
docker ps --format '{{.Names}}'

# Later when you're done running tests and want to run local servers again
sentry devservices down --project test && sentry devservices up
```

When using the `--project` option you can confirm which containers are running `docker ps`. Each running container should be prefixed with `test_`.
